        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>The Gym</h3>
            <p>A very motivated Saul Davila typically wakes up at 5 in the morning and begins his routine with 1.5 miles of running, followed by crunches, and push-ups. Saul does not believe in taking rest days and often pushes his body to its limits. He believes that pain only exists in the mind.</p>

            <h3>Motorcycle Riding</h3>
            <p>Saul lives in the Midwestern United States where temperatures can drop below 0 degrees Celsius during the harsh winter months. His recent purchase of an 'Indian' motorcycle has become his passion to ride. At the moment, he has it in storage, but plans to ride it daily to and from work, take long trips across the U.S., and simply enjoy the breeze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>Although very disciplined, Saul believes in decompression of the mind. He is not a party person, but prefers to stay at home, even if it means playing video games. At the moment, he enjoys playing a lot of FIFA (online soccer) and Call of Duty (a shooting/RPG type game). He typically plays video games before going to bed, but tries his best not to compromise his sleep as he still decides to wake up early in the morning.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Saul Davila</h2>
        <div class="goals-ambitions-motivation">
            <h3>A Career in Law Enforcement</h3>
            <p>According to Saul, he stays motivated by setting goals, visualizing success, and maintaining a positive mindset even in the face of difficulties. With no father figure and many siblings, they rely on him to be the role model and the household in charge.</p>
            <p>His transition from a Security position in a Retail store to pursuing a career in law enforcement began when he was a small child. His passion grew when he became a security guard in a retail store and was eventually promoted to a management position. He witnessed several things as a security guard that made his eagerness to join the police force even stronger.</p>
            <p>During his preparation for the police force, Saul encountered challenges such as balancing work, school, and personal commitments, due to several tests; but these experiences only fueled his determination to excel and serve his community with integrity and compassion.</p>
            <p>His advice to aspiring law enforcement professionals centers on resilience, adaptability, and fostering meaningful connections within the community. Recognizing the importance of empathy and cultural competency in building trust and collaboration, Saul mentions that this would be his third time into the police academy. He passed all tests, but due to a legal issue, he is unsure of the fate of his career. Nevertheless, he stays optimistic and tries his best not to give in or allow his emotions to control him.</p>

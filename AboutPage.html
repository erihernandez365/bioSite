                        <h3>Early Years</h3>
                        <p>A typical day for Saul includes structured gym sessions focusing on strength and endurance training by running and 
weight lifting. Saul mentions that he runs several miles, after which is followed by following his program that he has on 
his phone. It includes all the things he needs to do in the gym and after. For instance finding the right meals, such as 
what to eat and what types of exercises to do. If time allows he mentions that he decompresses his mind by playing 
video games. Some of which are football (FIFA) and RPG type games.</p>

                        <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                        <p>To manage his time effectively, Saul schedules his gym sessions before or after work shifts (since he has a rotating 
schedule), dedicates specific hours to studying Criminal Justice after his work shifts, and as soon as he is done with his 
school work, he collaborates with his mother to ensure household tasks are evenly distributed.</p>

                        <p> The decision to purchase a motorcycle in the summer of 2023 was driven by Saul's passion for adventure and the thrill 
of exploring Chicago's streets during the warmer months, offering him a sense of freedom and exhilaration. He felt the 
urge to purchase one as his uncle is also a motorcyclist. </p>
